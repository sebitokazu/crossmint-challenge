## Challenge Description

Welcome to our Crossmint coding challenge, in which you will help us mint a new megaverse into existence!

Megaverses are 2D spaces comprised of combinations of different astral objects: 🪐POLYanets with 🌙SOLoons around them and ☄comETHs floating around.

Your job as the master of the megaverse will be to create one with some given parameters and shapes. You will use a megaverse creator API to help you with such legendary quest.

The challenge is composed of 2 phases. In the first one you will learn how to interact with the API and create some 🪐POLYanets and validate them. In the second one you will create a bigger megaverse with some peculiar shape.
